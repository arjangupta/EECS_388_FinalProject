# EECS 388 Final Project
For my EECS 388 (Embedded Systems) Final Project, I programmed a game in C on a Stellaris TI LM3S1968 with a basic joystick sensor connected to it (hardware connections and soldering also done by me). Here is a video of me playing the game on the board: https://www.facebook.com/arjangupta/videos/vb.889005471/10156316291890472/?type=3&theater

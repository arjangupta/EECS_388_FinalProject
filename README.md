# EECS 388 Final ProjectFor my EECS 388 (Emedded Systems class - taken at KU) Final Project, I programmed a game in C on a Stellaris TI LM3S1968 with a basic joystick sensor connected to it (hardware connections and soldering also done by me). Here is a video of my playing the the game on the board: https://www.facebook.com/arjangupta/videos/vb.889005471/10156316291890472/?type=3&theater
